# 👋 Sorry, nothing to see here (for now)


I'm not a programmer, so you won’t find complex repositories here — but I *do* live and breathe tech every day. My work focuses more on **keeping systems running smoothly**, **networks connected**, and **people supported**.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Daffa Surya Mahardhika**, an **IT Support professional** with hands-on experience in:

- Troubleshooting user systems and network issues  
- Managing office infrastructure, servers, and internal services  
- Configuring VPNs and handling WAF-related incidents  
- Providing remote assistance via ticketing systems  
- Performing routine maintenance and data recovery tasks  

I’m currently involved in setting up network maps, managing proxy servers, preparing devices like PCs and printers for new branch offices, and ensuring everything works behind the scenes.

Outside of work, I’m a curious tinkerer — always excited to explore new hardware, fix devices, and keep up with emerging tech. I hold a **CCNA certification** and have a growing passion for **network engineering**.
